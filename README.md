Title: Tic Tac Toe Game

Description: The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic game of the battle between the x's and the o's. Whichever player lands three in a row first, wins.

How to Run: In order to run the Tic Tac Toe game, download index.html, myComponent.js, reactBootstrap.html, tictac.js, ticTacToe.jsx, and styles.css into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser and start your game of Tic Tac Toe.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, I would love to change the background, as well as add some additional styling features.
